## What is an audience?

An audience is a set of leads/phone numbers and their corresponding attributes that are called when you
create a [campaign](/essentials/campaigns#how-to-create-a-campaign).

## How to create an audience?

1. Go to the audience [dashboard](https://sapien-beige.vercel.app/dashboard/audience).
2. Click on `Create`, you should see a dashboard like this:
<img height="200" src="/images/create-audience.png" />
3. Click on the grey area it will prompt you to upload a csv file.
4. The csv file needs atleast the below two fields: \
    a. `phone`: A 10 digit phone number eg. `9637842000` \
    b. `countrycode`: A 2 digit country code, preceeded by a `+` symbol eg. `+01`

<Note>
You might need to add the `country_code` as `'+xx` instead of just `+xx` because excel considers `+` as a special character.
You can use this [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KM-MlsV73yU4Jhd_3Q7nQq9IqKDDcM1u/view?usp=sharing) as a sample.
</Note>

5. If your csv file has other fields, they will be available as custom fields in the [call script](/essentials/scripts#2-what-is-the-agent-doing). 
You can access custom fields in a script by mentioning them in the script as `|<column-name>|` where `<column-name>` is the name of the column in your csv. 
A sample of this is given under the scripts [section](/essentials/scripts#how-to-write-a-script).

6. Put in a value for the `Name` field.
7. Click on `Save`.

<Note>
While you can typically delete/update an audience once uploaded, you might not be allowed to do so if there is an existing campaign
that uses the information from this audience. If you really want to delete/update an audience either do so before creating a campaign or
if you have already created a campaign, you might have to delete the campaign before you can delete the audience.
