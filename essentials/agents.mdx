## What is an agent?

You can think of an agent as an AI equivalent of a sales/support personal in your company.
You can configure an agent with a custom script, just like the one you will give to your employee 
who talks to your leads. You can configure what type of 'employee' you want by changing his voice, behaviour etc.
You can create more than one agents for various usecases in your company.

## How to create an agent?

1. Go to the agents [dashboard](https://sapien-beige.vercel.app/dashboard/agent).
2. Click on 'create', you should see a dashboard like this:
<img height="200" src="/images/agent-dashboard.png" />
3. If you are here for the first time, just try the default 'call script' else, you can modify the script based on your requirements. You might not get this right the first time,
so try multiple scripts and see what works for you. Checkout [scripts](/essentials/scripts) or reach out to us at info@smallest.ai if you need help
with writing the script. Scripts might need updation over time based on change in customer behaviour and commonly asked questions.
4. Fill in the details on the right hand side that include:

    a. Name - Just a name for your agent. \
    b. Voice - You have a wide variety of voice options to choose from. Checkout [voices](/essentials/voices) for further information. \
    c. Conversions - This is basically a condition or a set of conditions for your AI agent to say whether you should consider a lead as 'converted' or 'not converted' (1/0).
    Checkout [conversions](/essentials/conversions) to read more. \
    d. Call From - This is the phone number your agent will call the customer from.
5. Click on 'save'.
