## What is a conversion?
A conversion is basically a condition that helps you understand which leads have been qualified
by an [agent](/essentials/agents) when running a [campaign](/essentials/campaigns). Some typical examples
of conversions are:
```
1. Customer expressed interest in your product
2. Customer answered atleast one question to the agent
3. Customer asked atleast one question to the agent
```
Apart from this, conversions can also be related to specific information given by the customer. For eg., 
some custom conversions for a real-estate agent (script given [here](/essentials/scripts#how-to-write-a-script)) are:
```
1. Customer is looking to buy a property in next few days
2. Customer is looking to buy a property in Manhatten
3. Customer has a budget above 2 million USD
```

## How to create a conversion?
1. Go to the agent [dashboard](https://sapien-beige.vercel.app/dashboard/agent/create).
2. Click on `Create`, you should see a dashboard, where on the right side, there is a field called `Conversion`, as given
below:

3. Click on `Add Conversion` and then click on `Create Conversion` from the dropdown. You should see a pop-up like this:
<img height="200" src="/images/create-conversion.png" />
4. Fill in a suitable value for `Name` and explain the condition in words in the given text area, as mentioned in 
[this](/essentials/conversions#what-is-a-conversion) section. Pick any one for now, for example:
```
Customer expressed interest in your product
```
5. Click on `Save`.

## How are multiple conversions handled?

You must have observed that you can add multiple conversions to a single agent as shown below:
<img height="200" src="/images/conversions-list.png" />

Here, we are processing 3 conversions `is-interested`, `asked-question` and `buy-soon`. The operators
for them are `OR`, `AND` and `OR` respectively. These are evaluated as ((`is-interested` `AND` `asked-question`) `OR` `buy-soon`).
We ignore the first operator corresponding to `is-interested`.

Mapping this to a real-world example, let's say you have the [script](/essentials/scripts#how-to-write-a-script) of a real-estate agent and 
have the following values for `is-interested`, `asked-question` and `buy-soon` conversions respectively:
```
Customer has expressed interest in buying the property.
```
```
Customer has asked atleast one question to Meloni.
```
```
Customer wants to buy the property in the next 3 months.
```

Now if the customer expresses interest, but did not ask a question to Meloni, and did not mention anything about
the period in which he/she is looking to buy, the lead would be marked as `not-converted` or `0` when you 
[start](/essentials/campaigns#how-to-create-a-campaign) a campaign.
